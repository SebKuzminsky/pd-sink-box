# Introduction

![overview picture](pics/intro.png)

This device provides power from a USB PD source (such as a cheap modern
phone charger) to a pair of screw terminals, and lets the user select
the voltage and max current from among what the PD source offers.

USB PD sources typically offer one or more voltages (5V, 9V, 12V, 15V,
18V, and 20V), each with its own current limit.

# Design

This device is based on the HUSB238 USB PD Sink chip and an RP2040
microcontroller (Raspberry Pi Pico).

The user interface is a small screen and a rotary-encoder/push-button
knob.  The UI shows the active power, and lets the user select among
the alternatives offered by the USB-PD Source.

The device also includes a Mini360 buck converter to power the 3.3V
control electronics from whatever voltage the USB PD source is currently
supplying.  The buck converter powers the Pico via its VSYS input
(protected by an 1N5817 Schottky diode).  The HUSB238 can't provide
power below 5V, so it does not need a boost converter.  This way you
can plug the Pico into a computer via USB for development/debugging and
"UI-over-serial", even while it's connected to a 20V USB-PD source.

The Pico talks I2C to the HUSB238.

The Pico talks SPI to the display.

Custom 3d printed enclosure (FCStd & STLs in this repo)

Misc fasteners (see below)

Misc hookup wire, mostly 24 AWG stranded or similar, plus a short length
of red & black in 18 AWG.


# Enclosure

The enclosure is 3d printed from the FreeCAD file in this repo.
The plastic parts include standoffs with holes that I drill to size and
tap M2.  This works surprisingly well.

The screen is mounted with #4-40 flat head screws because they're about
the right size and it's what I happened to have on hand, though maybe
M2.5 would have been more consistent.


## Design

The enclosure is designed to make the device easier to assemble.  You can
have all the the electronics assembled and mounted, but have the case
off so everything is visible and accessible.

The stack looks like this, starting at the bottom:

1.  The "base-plate" holds the HUSB238 and Mini360.  It has standoffs
    for the mid-plate.

2.  The "mid-plate" is mounted on the standoffs of the base-plate.
    It has standoffs for mounting the Pico, and standoffs for the screen.
    There are slots in the mid-plate that allow easy wiring from below
    (power from the Mini360 and I2C to the HUSB238).

3.  The "lid" or "case" is an inverted bowl that sits on top of the
    mid-plate.  The screen and the encoder knob both mount to the lid.
    The screws that attach the screen to the lid go into the standoffs
    on the mid-plate.  The encoder knob is panel-mounted to the lid with
    its own nut and washer.

You can unscrew the screen screws and the nut on the encoder knob and
take the lid off, and run the whole thing without the case.  You can
attach the screen to its standoffs on the mid-plate without the lid
(though the encoder knob has nowhere other than the lid to mount to,
so it's free floating in this configuration).


## Slicer

I configured my slicer to print 5 perimeters, to make the standoffs
stronger and more able to take a tap.

I configured my slicer to print the first layer at elevated temperatures,
to aid with print-bed adhesion and avoid corner lifting: 210째C nozzle,
65째C bed.  The rest of the part is printed at 190째C/60째C.  This is
working great.


## Fasteners

# Assembly


## Enclosure prep

Drill the holes to be tapped M2 with #53 (0.059 inch, 1.499 mm).
* 6x on the Base Plate
* 5x on the Mid Plate
* 2x on the Lid

Tap them M2.  Only the HUSB238 holes are any challenge, since for
aesthetic reasons they are blind.

Drill the M2 clearance holes with #44 (0.086inch, 2.184mm).
* 4x on the Mid Plate
* 3x on the Mid Plate End Cap

Drill the holes to be tapped #4-40, on the screen standoffs #43 (0.089
inch, 2.261 mm).

Tap the #4-40 holes on the screen standoffs.

Drill the #4-40 clearance holes in the lid #30 (0.129 inch, 3.264 mm).


## Base plate

Solder the I2C leads on the HUSB238.  Blue for SDA, yellow for SCK.
These are about 20 mm long.

Solder power leads to the HUSB238 board, one pair long to go to the
screw terminal and one pair short to go to the Mini360.

Solder the short power leads from the HUSB238 to the input points on
the Mini360.

Solder power output leads to the Mini360, including a Schottky diode on
the +VOUT line, but *do not* connect them anywhere yet.  Note: the diode
does not fit through the slot in the mid-plate, so ensure there's an
adequate lead on the Pico side.

Mount the HUSB238 and Mini360 to the base-plate.

Connect the HUSB238 to power and adjust the pot on the Mini360 to get
about 3.3V after the diode.


## Mid plate

Mount the mid-plate on its standoffs on the base-plate.

Mount the Pico on its standoffs on the mid-plate.  The USB connector and
BOOTSEL button should be on the side that's *not* covered by the display.

Route the 3.3V and GND output lines from the Mini360 through the slots
in the mid-plate to pins 39 (VSYS) an 38 (GND) and solder them in place.


### Connect the rotary encoder knob to the Pico

Solder the leads as follows:

* Size the leads so that the top of the square body of the rotary
encoder (just under the washer & nut) is level with the tops of the
screen standoffs.

```
Pico GPIO | Pico Pin | Knob pin
----------+----------+-----------
GPIO 0    | 1        | A
GND       | 3        | C (center on 3-pin side)
GPIO 1    | 2        | B
----------+----------+-----------
GND       | 38       | either pin on 2-pin side
GPIO 2    | 4        | other pin on 2-pin side
----------+----------+-----------
```

* If the side with the three pins is facing you, with the shaft up,
then the pins are A, C, B.

* When stripping the wire to solder to the pico, very short exposed
conductors are sufficient, 2mm or so.


### Connect the HUSB238 to the Pico

Solder the I2C leads as follows:

```
Name | Pico pin | Direction | HUSB238 | Color
-----+---------+-----------+---------+-------
SDA  | 21       | <->       | SDA     | blue
SCL  | 22       |  ->       | SCL     | yellow
```


### Connect the display to the PICO

Temporarily mount the display on its standoffs.

Solder leads between Pico and the vias on the display board.  Bring the
wires up from the underside of the display board and clip any excess wire
on the top side flush with the board, to avoid interfering with the lid.

```
Pico Name          | Pico Pin | Direction | Display
-------------------+----------+-----------+--------
3.3V               | 36       |  ->       | VCC
GND                | 23       | <->       | GND
spi1 TX (GPIO 15)  | 20       |  ->       | DIN
spi1 SCK (GPIO 14) | 19       |  ->       | CLK
GPIO 3             | 5        |  ->       | CS
GPIO 5             | 7        |  ->       | D/C
GPIO 4             | 6        |  ->       | RST
PWM 4B (GPIO 9)    | 12       |  ->       | BL
```

Note: We solder individual wires rather than using the connector on the
screen because the connector comes out the side and interferes with the
case wall.


## Lid

Remove the temporary screws holding the screen on its standoffs.

Remove the nut & washer from the rotary encoder knob.

Slide the lid carefully over the main assembly.

* The rotary encoder knob should come up through its hole.  Attach it
with its washer and nut.

* Align the mounting holes in the screen with the holes in the lid and
in the standoffs, and screw it securely into place.
